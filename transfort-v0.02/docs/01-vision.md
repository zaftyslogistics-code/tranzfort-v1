# Product Vision (v0.02)

## Problem
Logistics workflows are fragmented across calls/WhatsApp/manual tracking. Load discovery, posting, verification, and communication are not centralized.

## Vision
A fast, reliable marketplace and workflow system connecting:
- Suppliers (post loads, manage shipments)
- Truckers (discover loads, communicate, manage fleet identity)
- Admins (verify users, moderate, oversee system health)

## Success Metrics (Client-Delivery)
- Startup time: target P95 <= 2.0s on mid-range Android devices.
- Crash-free sessions: >= 99.5%.
- Core flow completion: load post + load discovery + chat + verification.
- Operational readiness: repeatable releases + rollback plan.

## Out of Scope (initial)
- Payments
- Complex route optimization
- Multi-country compliance workflows
