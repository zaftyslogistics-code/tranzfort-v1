# Transfort v0.02

## Goal
Deliver a production-grade Transfort rebuild (v0.02) with a clean, maintainable codebase while reusing existing Supabase infrastructure where appropriate.

## Non-Negotiables (Client Delivery Standards)
- Performance-first: fast startup, fast navigation, low crash rate.
- Secure-by-default: strong RLS, least-privilege access, audited admin capabilities.
- Maintainable: clear architecture boundaries, consistent state management, consistent navigation.
- Testable: automated checks + repeatable release process.

## Documentation
See `docs/00-index.md`.
